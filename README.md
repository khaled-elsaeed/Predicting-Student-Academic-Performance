# Student Percentage Prediction using Supervised ML

This project is designed for beginners and focuses on predicting a student's percentage based on the number of study hours. It involves a simple linear regression task with just two variables.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates a student's percentage based on the number of hours they dedicate to studying. We will leverage supervised machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

To conduct this analysis, we will use a dataset that can be accessed at [http://bit.ly/w-data](http://bit.ly/w-data). This dataset contains the necessary information to train and test our predictive model.

## Tools and Languages

Notebook --> Google Colab

languages --> Pyhon

## Prediction

A key question we aim to answer in this project is: "What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?" This prediction will provide valuable insights into the relationship between study hours and academic performance.
